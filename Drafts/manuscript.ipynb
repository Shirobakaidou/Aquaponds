The coastal pond aquaculture was continuously under expansion and has increased for 10% of the size of 2019 till 1993 and since then entered a fluctuating phase for eight years. In 2001, the production size was roughly the same as in 1993. Since 2001, the coastal pond aquaculture in Myanmar has grown rapidly. About 20% of the pond area of 2019 thrived in three years between 2001 and 2014. From 2004 to 2011, the production size increased for another 20% despite some fluctuations and reached 80% of the size of 2019. After staying nearly unchanged for three years, the expansion was again sped up and increased for 20% from 2014 to 2019. It is noticeable that from 2002 to 2004 and in 2011, the pond area increased more sharply than the pond count, implying that there were probably more large-area ponds constructed in those years.\n","\n","In Thailand, around 40% of the production size of 2019 was existing in 1988. Before 2000, the production size appeared to often fluctuate abruptly; but substantially it increased at a very high speed; the production size was expanded for 20% of the size of 2019 in about 5 years on average and reached 80% by the end of the last century. After 2000, the expansion tended to slow down; in average it took 10 years to increase for 10% of the size of 2019 whereas the fluctuations appeared to become more flattened.\n","\n","In Vietnam, about 65% of the production size of 2019 was presented in 1988. Due to about 20% data gap in 1990 and 1992 `(FigX)`, it is hard to revert its development pattern of coastal pond aquaculture in late 80s and early 90s. Yet according to the result that the year 1989 and 1993 presented smaller production size than the previous year in spite of few data gaps `(FigX)`, it can be inferred that the coastal pond aquaculture in Vietnam might have once thrived before 1988, then shrinked abruptly in 1989, recovered a bit in the following years but shrinked again in 1993. In 1994, the production size was expanded for about 10% of the size of 2019, reaching the same level as in 1988. After staying relatively stable for 3 years, the production size shrinked again abruptly in 1998 but recovered drastically in 1999, reaching at 75% of the size of 2019.\n","\n","It is also noticeable that the count of aquaculture ponds experienced a sharper shrinkage in 1989 and a sharper growth in 1999 compared to the area of ponds, implying that it was especially the small-area ponds that have been abandoned or reconstructed.\n","\n","From 2000 to 2008, the coastal pond aquaculture has been continuously expanded for about 20% of the size of 2019.
